```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code compiles and runs correctly, but it's inefficient for large lists.  The `sort` function uses a merge sort, which has O(n log n) complexity. For very large lists, this can be slow.

The bug is not an error in the code's functionality but rather in its performance for large datasets.
